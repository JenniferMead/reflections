What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You start a new repository. This is important or you could never start any new projects!

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Its an inbetween area that allows you to add files in controlled groups that make sense
together as commits as opposed to having to add every file at once from the working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Only add things to the staging area when it makes sense to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would help when I am trying to make changes to a project that I am unsure about or if I want there to be several different options within the project (ex: difficulty levels or languages).

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The allow you to see branches in a way thats easy to understand.
