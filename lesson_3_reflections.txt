When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are working with other people and want them to be able to see the changes you are making.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Partly to keep track of your changes in a way that makes sense to you but also becuase you don't 
want to share things with your coworkers or the public until they are ready and github has
no way of determining if your project is ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks copy repositories from one to another on github only. Clones pull copies of repositories from
github to your local computer. Branches allow you to make different versions of your projects that are
all saved under the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I am unsure.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Honestly I really wouldn't want to collaborate without it! But if I did, I supposed we would 
exchange emails. There wouldn't be the complication of learning github, but it would take
a lot of time to go through the code to see what other people changed.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Anytime your worried about breaking the master branch. It allows you to see how those changes would actually work.
